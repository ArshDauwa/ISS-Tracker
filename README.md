# ISS Tracker

## Description
This Python Flask application serves as a RESTful API for accessing real-time and historical data related to the International Space Station (ISS). It retrieves XML data from a NASA API endpoint, parses it, and exposes endpoints for querying information such as the ISS's current location, speed, altitude, and geoposition. Error handling is implemented to provide appropriate responses in case of any issues during data retrieval or processing.
